# GimbalQuaternionsVisualization
GUI with python to interactively demonstrate the difference between using gimbals and using quaternions for spacecraft rotation.

STATUS: actively being worked on

DONE:   mockup/proof of concept 

TODO:   1. full GUI with all nessesary elements
        2. 3D Object using Vectors
        3. implement math functions for rotation
        4. compile into standalone applet
  
This is a study project and should be finished relatively quickly.
This project will probably be using python and libraries numpy, matplotlib and tkinter.
