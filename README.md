# GimbalQuaternionsVisualization
GUI with python to interactively demonstrate the difference between using gimbals and using quaternions for spacecraft rotation.

STATUS: actively being worked on

DONE:
1. mockup/proof of concept for 3D Graphs
2. GUI with graphs and sliders plus a few extras

TODO:   
1. fix Slider functionality
2. fix Reset Button functionality
3. Add Rotation Matrix and Quaternion display
4. create 3D object using Vectors
5. implement math functions for rotation
6. compile into standalone applet
  
This is a study project and should be finished relatively quickly.
This project will probably be using python and libraries numpy, matplotlib and tkinter.
